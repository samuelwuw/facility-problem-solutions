# facility-problem-solutions
This is a repository for my masters decree project.
This repository contains a script capable of receive a series of demand points and generate facilities that will supply these points.
The script is a R markdown notebook. To run, select the data base in the first chunk, set a number of facility candidates in the second chunk and run all the chunks below.

The script will generate a star graph with the demand points and selected facilities. Other outputs are the facility installation costs and the transport costs for all facilities.
This is a comnbinatory problem, solved in multiple steps using Artificial Neural Networks and linear programming.
